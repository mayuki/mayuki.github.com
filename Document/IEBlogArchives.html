<article><h1><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2004/07/21/190687.aspx">Welcome to the IE Team Blog!</a></h1><p>We’ve heard loud and clear that many people want a better connection with the IE Team. We’re happy to do something about it. Our goal in this blog is to be a good place, direct from the source, for information about IE. What are we working on? How do we make decisions? Why does some part of IE work the way it does? What keeps us up late at night? What are we thinking of around security, extensibility, and other key areas? Hey, any good tips and tricks? Some people on the team have already been doing...</p></article>
<article><h1><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2004/07/21/190747.aspx">I Love This Browser!</a></h1><p>I hopefully got your attention with the title of my first post. And it is definitely true for me, as I have loved browsing the web since I started way back in the mid 90s, and I really love browsing with IE. Yet, you may ask who I am or who we are that will be posting on this blog. I am Scott Stearns, the test manager for the Microsoft Internet Explorer team (as Dean says we will be pulling together full bios of people later). The IE team as we usually say. Some of us have our individual blogs today...</p></article>
<article><h1><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2004/07/21/190777.aspx">Useful Resources</a></h1><p>Now that we have the team blog going I thought it'd be useful to share a few of what we see as essential resources. You'll see links to these at the side of this page as well and I'm sure we'll add more links over time. You can find my own blog at http://blogs.msdn.com/dmassy Thanks -Dave Massy Internet Explorer Program Management team Useful Resources There are lots of useful resources for Internet Explorer that we’d like to point out to you in case you are not familiar with them. Blogs - There...</p></article>
<article><h1><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2004/07/22/191629.aspx">Rules for Comments on the IEBlog</a></h1><p>I am glad to see what got lots of feedback and discussion around our posts from yesterday. I am still digging through all the comments from yesterday and today, but I did notice some profanity. As people get more engaged with IEBlog, we want to set down some guidelines on how we are going handle comments in general. Our primary goal is for this to be a place for open discussion about IE, so we don’t want to have lots of overhead and process. Things we want to see in comments: Lots of good interesting...</p></article>
<article><h1><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2004/07/22/192138.aspx">What we talk about on IEBlog</a></h1><p>I will paraphrase Jeff Davis , a developer on the IE team, when it comes to setting parameters for what we will and will not talk about IEBlog. 
 We will happily post and discuss issues around what features should be in IE, how features work in IE, the importance of application compatibility in IE, tips and tricks in IE, answers to technical issues, security and extensibility in IE, web browsing in general, and what keeps us up at night. 
 For better or worse, there are some things we are just...</p></article>
<article><h1><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2004/07/23/193120.aspx">Overwhelming Response</a></h1><p>Thanks for the overwhelming amount of feedback and discussion. After work yesterday, I spent some of my time reading through the comments to my post (instead of reading the 9/11 Commission report). It looks the comments have grown some since I pulled this together last night. Here is my basic breakdown of what I am seeing in the response to my post. I list them in no particular order; most are improvement requests while some are data points. I have to say my favorite is the comparison of IE to Courtney...</p></article>
<article><h1><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2004/07/23/193152.aspx">We've been Scoblized</a></h1><p>Great to get a link from Mr Scoble on the IEBlog. For people who are interested in applying for employment at Microsoft here’s a link . There is also the jobsblog , which talks about the different possible career paths at Microsoft. The IE team is a great place to work with lots of smart friendly people. Scott</p></article>
<article><h1><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2004/07/26/197754.aspx">Launching Favorites from the Address Bar with Keyword Names</a></h1><p>Here is a tip to make your IE favorites more powerful. You can make the name of favorites keywords that if typed in the address bar will launch the favorite. For example, say you like to go to your favorite web email site a lot, but you don’t want to make it your home page. Simply add a favorite that takes you to the web email site in the main favorites folder (this won’t work if you put it in a subfolder). Then rename the favorite to something easy to type. For example, I go to http://www.hotmail...</p></article>
<article><h1><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2004/07/27/198458.aspx">Welcome to Internet Explorer Security  </a></h1><p>My name is John, and I work on the Internet Explorer team. It's a little hard to explain my actual function on the team, but my current official title is "Development Manager". I'm also something of an adrenaline junkie. I'm big into back country and park/pipe snow boarding , semi-closed circuit rebreather and mixed gas diving , hiking and climbing up and around Mount Rainer , and spelunking into Internet Explorer code and architecture (I’m not sure which of my passions is most challenging). Frankly...</p></article>
<article><h1><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2004/07/30/202589.aspx">MS04-025</a></h1><p>There’s a new security update for IE available. You can find the security bulletin here http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS04-025.mspx and the Knowledge Base article here http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?kbid=867801 Candidly, I’d like to write in depth about the vulnerability, different approaches we thought of in defending against it and the compatibility issues (site and application) that each approach entailed, and how we chose the one that we released. The main reason...</p></article>

<article><h1><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2004/08/10/212008.aspx">IE in Windows XP SP2</a></h1><p>Hi, I’m Tony Chor, the Group Program Manager for the Internet Explorer team. As you may know, we’ve been working hard on IE for Windows XP Service Pack 2, and we signed off on it last week. You can get a very detailed description of the changes on MSDN. (This is lovingly referred to internally as the Book of Springboard – Springboard was the codename for XP SP2.) However, I thought I’d give a high level description of the kinds of changes we made and why. First, as with any project, we set our goals...</p></article>
<article><h1><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2004/08/13/214403.aspx">See video of Dean, the leader of the Internet Explorer team</a></h1><p>Channel 9 has just released a video where Dean discusses the exciting challenge of leading the Internet Explorer team. It’s well worth watching this and all the other videos on Channel 9 which often give an understanding into the motivation behind the projects we undertake. For those of you who aren’t aware, Channel 9 was established by five guys at Microsoft to allow you to get an insight into Microsoft and as a forum for discussion. If you aren’t a member then join up, it does require an email...</p></article>
<article><h1><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2004/08/13/214415.aspx">Pending Comment Problem Fixed</a></h1><p>The comments system for blogs.msdn.com was recently upgraded and the default was changed to block automatic posting of comments. I have changed it back, which means all comments should show up without having to be published and I also published any comments that were pending. Scott</p></article>
<article><h1><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2004/08/17/216075.aspx">How the IE team is organized</a></h1><p>As we’ve been posting we’ve been mentioning our titles, but we haven’t really explained what those titles mean or what we do on the IE team, so I thought I’d explain. Like many Microsoft product teams, there are three primary job functions that are dedicated to IE: Development, Test, and Program Management. In addition to these roles, we have key members of our virtual team who are shared with other parts of the Windows organization; these are jobs like SDK Writer, Localizer, Designer, Product Manager...</p></article>
<article><h1><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2004/08/17/216080.aspx">The Basics of the IE Testing Matrix</a></h1><p>As we recently shipped security update MS04-025, I thought it would be good to talk about the testing coverage that we do for each security update. Testing is about risk management, and we have to make judgments about where to invest heavily in testing and where to invest less in testing to achieve the highest quality IE when we release. Code change is one main driver of this (test where the code is changing), but another important part of the process is to understand the larger landscape of what...</p></article>
<article><h1><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2004/08/24/219885.aspx">IE User Experience</a></h1><p>My name is Bruce Morgan, and I am another one of the development managers on the IE team. I manage the developers who work on the User Experience of IE – the UI and related infrastructure. I spend most of my time focused on the features “outside the rectangle” of the page the user is browsing, such as Favorites, History, the “Internet Options” dialog, and the like. Essentially, John is focused on security and platform issues, Dave is on web developer issues, and I’m all about the end-user feature...</p></article>
<article><h1><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2004/08/25/220501.aspx">Avenues of Support for IE</a></h1><p>I have noticed going through the comments for our entries, that some people have started posting comments that are specific asks for help with IE issues. This blog is not focused on being a support forum, but we will try to help people as we can. If you are looking for more expedient and focused help please see the Microsoft Internet Explorer Support page - http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/support/default.mspx . Also please use the Contact link ( http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/contact.aspx ) as mechanism...</p></article>
<article><h1><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2004/08/26/221116.aspx">More details on Pop-Up Blocking in XPSP2</a></h1><p>There have been some questions about how pop-up blocking works in XPSP2 in the comments. Jeff Davis , one of the IE developers who worked on this feature in XPSP2, has put together a post ( http://blogs.msdn.com/jeffdav/archive/2004/08/25/220737.aspx ) that gives more details on what we consider a user initiated click. If you want to get better sense for how it works, please take a read through his latest entry - mouseDown + mouseUp = click . Thanks. Scott</p></article>
<article><h1><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2004/08/26/221242.aspx">New Internet Explorer Community Site</a></h1><p>We’ve just launched a new Community site for Internet Explorer to help support end users. This is linked from the main Internet Explorer page on www.microsoft.com . It includes links to other Internet Explorer sites, downloads and hints and tips. This site is focused on providing resources to end users but we also have sites with information for other parts of the wide audience for Internet Explorer: Resources for developers at the Internet Explorer Developers Center on MSDN Resources for the IT...</p></article>

Main statement – “Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2 (SP2) significantly improves your computer's defenses against attacks and vulnerabilities.” They specifically talked about IE changes, including local machine zone lockdown. Full advisory is at http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/alerts/SA04-243A.html . Thanks. Scott</p></article>

I’ve worked on IE on and off since the IE 3.0 days, and have been involved in every major Windows release since Windows 95. I work with Dean, Scott, Tony, Dave, and the others who have or will be posting here to make sure that the IE team is working on the right things and at the right times. I wanted to drop a quick note to make sure people knew about an update to our user agent string in Windows XP Service...</p></article>

This includes defining and communicating the IE value proposition for all customer segments and helping the product team with long-term product strategy. I posted a comment last week about Windows Marketplace on the Community Site entry and wanted to follow up with more info. Windows Marketplace went live this week and contains an entire section devoted to browser add-ons. This section comes directly from Download.com so all add-ons...</p></article>

Next up: Windows Server 2003 SP1 and Windows XP 64-bit edition v2003, which are both currently in Beta. Both these platforms will receive the same treatment as XPSP2 did for IE: they’ll get all our security improvements, the pop-up blocker, the information bar, etc. See Tony’s blog entry about IE in XPSP2 for more info &amp; links about the changes we made in XPSP2.

<article><h1><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2004/09/09/227542.aspx">More on IE's UA string and the SV1 token</a></h1><p>In earlier posts, Christopher mentioned that for Windows XP SP2 and Windows Server 2003 SP1 the UA string was getting a new ‘SV1’ decorator. This has stirred up a flurry of questions and comments about our reasoning behind this decision. Why did we add ‘SV1’ instead of update the IE version number? Well, we know from past experience that changing the version number can have a huge impact on site and application compatibility. We felt that since IE for XPSP2 and WS03SP1 does not have significant changes...</p></article>

I’ll post more about myself in another time, but I’d like to talk briefly about opting into the security features we added in XPSP2. For example, we’ve made it extremely easy to opt existing applications that use the WebBrowser Control into the XPSP2 Information Bar without having to recompile the application. In the registry under the key: HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main\FeatureControl...</p></article>

However, there are usually a number of things you wish you had had more time to make better and every time you run across it in the product it drives you crazy. One thing that bothers me with IE in XPSP2 is the amount of hoops you need to click through to set Google or some other search engine as your autosearch provider. A quick way to set Google is to use the reg file up on...</p></article>
<article><h1><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2004/10/14/242445.aspx">A fresh IE security update</a></h1><p>Earlier this week we released the latest security update for IE, MS04-038 . We’ve been working on this since XPSP2 shipped, and it’s nice to see it made available to customers on Windows Update . This update addresses, among other issues, the drag &amp; drop vulnerability that’s been in the news &amp; security circles lately. This is also the first IE update to use the our latest installation technology , so corporations who deploy Microsoft products and updates will have a more uniform experience...</p></article>
<article><h1><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2004/10/15/243074.aspx">Compatibility, or “Just Don’t Break My Site!”</a></h1><p>We’ve had more than a few comments suggesting that IE works too hard at backwards compatibility, and we cater to those people who “don’t code their pages correctly”, or people who otherwise “didn’t do things the right way”. These comments frequently go on to suggest that we (the IE team) should use our market position to “force people to fix their broken stuff”. I’d like to explain why we so adamantly disagree with that position, and why we work so hard at backwards compatibility. We feel it is vitally...</p></article>

The story also includes pointers to the tools he used for hammering the browsers. Here is a bit of his report: 6) Pointless rants It appears that the overall quality of code, and more importantly, the amount of QA, on various browsers touted as "secure", is not up to par with MSIE; the...</p></article>

Script debugging is turned off by default you can enable it by going to: Tools-&gt;Internet Options…-&gt;Advanced-&gt;Disable Script Debugging Prior to XPSP2 the above will turn script debugging on for all applications that host the WebBrowser control (Outlook for example). On XPSP2 we’ve split the option into two: Tools-&gt;Internet Options…-&gt;Advanced-&gt;Disable Script Debugging (Internet Explorer) Tools...</p></article>

As part of this thread it also talked about a power toy called Tweakomatic. Named to follow along in the great TweakUI power toy tradition, Tweakomatic is a tool for setting and configuring Windows and IE Settings. There are other ways to manipulate IE settings like group policy, but for a quick...</p></article>

It is amazing to think that they not only won the World Series for the first time since 1918, but they did it in extraordinary fashion, winning 8 straight games against two of the best teams in baseball. Before I started working with a VIC-20 or a Commodore 64, I was a baseball fanatic. I grew up in New England (Vermont to be exact) living and dying with the fate of the Red Sox.

Here are a few changes we’ve made over the last month or so. A Simplified Table of Contents This can be seen in the panel on the left under Web Development. The previous table of contents was a bit confused and often made it a struggle to find topics that were relevant.

Every day, there’s new software released for Windows. Today, with Firefox’s release, is no different. As someone who has worked on many big software projects over the last few years, I’m happy for the developers who worked on it. Signing off on your work and letting the rest of the world use it feels good. As someone who works on Windows, I think more software for Windows is a good thing.

This fixes a heap-based buffer overflow that allows remote execution (see CAN-2004-1050 for more details on the specifics of the issue). Full details on the security update can be found in the security bulletin . If you are running IE6 SP1 or IE 6 I strongly suggest you go to Windows Update to get this security release.

A big part of my job is to research potential IE security vulnerabilities reported to Microsoft by 3 rd parties: security vendors, site developers, or simply observant users.

As you may have noticed, we have turned on comment moderation due to the copious amounts of blog spam we have gotten lately. This means there will be some delay for us to review the comments and then post the ones that are not spam.

We had to make a choice with the 64-bit client as to which browser, the 32-bit or 64-bit, would be the default.

In IE, the different areas of the Web are partitioned into a set of security zones. The topic I would like to talk about is programmatically adding sites to those zones.

 The main thing I talked about is the deep platform support for RSS that we’re building into the next version of Windows codenamed “Windows Longhorn.”

 In the revised Security Advisory provided earlier today, we recommend disabling Javaprxy.dll by using the registry key update (A.K.A. “killbit”) that is available now from the Microsoft Download Center. You’ll find a link in the updated advisory. This killbit package will also be available on Windows Update soon.

This is due to a recent change to bring the behavior of these dialogs closer to their window.open cousins. In essence, we want to free developers from worrying about how much content size they are going to get when they request a modal or modeless dialog (from IE7 and onward). Note: our definition of content size...</p></article>

 The answer is simple: IE6SP1’s support policy will not change when IE7 ships. Everywhere that IE6SP1 is supported today, IE6SP1 will continue to be supported until the OS it ships with expires. Are you running IE6SP1 on Windows 2000 SP4? You will...</p></article>

Here are some facts that hope will answer some of those questions. 
 Prior to starting general AU distribution to IE6 users, IE7 was available via the IE site for several weeks. This brought IE7 to a wider range of users than the beta and enabled us to watch for any issues. The initial rollout went well and we continue to monitor customer feedback through many channels...</p></article>

 Many applications install and use versions 4 and the original version 6 of the control as a part of the XML Core Services. The most common versions of MSXML don’t require any update such as MSXML3 and the version of MSXML6 installed with Windows Vista.

 Microsoft recently published a set of Interoperability Principles . Thinking about IE8’s behavior with these principles in mind, interpreting web content in the most standards compliant way possible is a better thing to do. 
 We think that acting in accordance with principles is important, and IE8’s default is a...</p></article>

 The writing-mode property enables text layout for non-Latin languages like Japanese and Arabic. Supported in IE since release 5.5, this property has been significantly updated in IE8. Our goals were threefold: 
 
 To make its behavior more predictable for developers 
 To align with relatively newer CSS concepts like shrink-to-fit sizing 
 To further the CSS3 Text Layout module by providing the first implementation. 
 This post walks through the basics of the new implementation...</p></article>

This creates some challenges with regards to compatibility with existing web content. 
 Some of today’s web pages expect the older, less interoperable behavior from IE and, as a result, don’t necessarily work as expected in IE8’s standards-by-default mode. To address this, we built features like Compatibility View and...</p></article>

Back in January, I went on record as being someone who thinks that CSP is a good idea. 
 CSP is a mechanism for declarative security , whereby a site communicates its intent and leaves it up to the user-agent to determine how to enforce it. 
 There are a number of benefits to declarative security mechanisms: 
 
 Reduced compatibility risks. Because sites must opt-in and declare what, if...</p></article>

Testing is about risk management, and we have to make judgments about where to invest heavily in testing and where to invest less in testing to achieve the highest quality IE when we release.

This has stirred up a flurry of questions and comments about our reasoning behind this decision. Why did we add ‘SV1’ instead of update the IE version number?

Of the spam I receive, a significant number of messages represent phishing attacks .
